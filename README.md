# Supermarket Sales Analysis – Excel + Power BI Project

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on supermarket sales data. First, I cleaned the data using Excel. After that, I created a sales dashboard in Power BI to show key insights like total sales, quantity, tax, and gross income.

## My Process:

1. **Excel Data Cleaning:**

   * Removed duplicates.
   * Handled missing values.
   * Created new columns like Tax 5% and Gross Income.

2. **Power BI Dashboard:**

   * Imported the cleaned Excel file.
   * Added visuals:

     * KPI Cards (Total Sales, Quantity, Tax, Gross Income)
     * Sales by Customer Type (Bar Chart)
     * Sales by City (Map Chart)
     * Monthly Sales Trend (Line Chart)
     * Product Line Breakdown (Pie Chart)
